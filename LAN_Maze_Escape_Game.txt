LAN Maze Escape Game
This is a console-based, multiplayer LAN game built in Java. Players connect to a server, navigate a maze, and try to find the exit.

Core Concepts
Client-Server Architecture: The server manages the game state and client connections, while each client handles player input and renders the game on the console.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project uses separate classes for the Server, Client, Maze, and Player to demonstrate principles like encapsulation and modularity.

Networking: Communication is handled using Java Sockets and multithreading to allow for real-time updates.

How to Run
Compile the files:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where these files are saved, and run the following command:

javac *.java

Run the Server:
In your terminal, start the server application. The server will wait for clients to connect.

java Server

Run the Clients:
Open a new terminal window for each player and start the client application. The clients will attempt to connect to the server running on localhost.

java Client

You can run this command multiple times to have multiple players.

How to Play
Once a client connects, it will prompt you for a player name. The game is displayed on the console.

Use the commands up, down, left, right to move.

The player is represented by a P on the maze.

The exit is represented by an E.

Walls are represented by #.

Empty space is represented by a      .

The game ends for a player when they successfully find the exit. The server will broadcast this win to all other players.
